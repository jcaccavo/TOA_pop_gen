Installing smc++
- Is not easy
- The github says to use something called docker, but docker requires admin privileges that are not accessible on the server
- They then say to use [singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.7/user-guide/), which I managed to install, but then it is not clear at all how to use singularity to then install smc++
- They say that conda is no longer supported, though there was [issue#253](https://github.com/popgenmethods/smcpp/issues/253) that had managed to install smc++ via conda in a separate, uniquely created (e.g. smcpp_env) environment
- This still did not work
- [issue#265](https://github.com/popgenmethods/smcpp/issues/265) saved the day; they explained that only a python package [mpfr-4.2.1.tar.xz](http://mpfr-4.2.1.tar.xz/) was needed to install smc++
- To install this, I downloaded the `mpfr-4.2.1.tar.xz` file from the [mpfr.org](http://mpfr.org/) website
- I then uploaded the file to my x_scripts folder on the server, and used `tar -xf mpfr-4.2.1.tar.xz` to extract the folder from the file
- I followed the [instructions to install mpfr](https://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html#Installing-MPFR) from mpfr.org 
- In the mpfr-4.2.1 directory, I typed `./configure` (exactly like that "period, forward slash, configure"), and this began the installation process
- Then I typed `make`, which precipitated a very long text output, but that eventually did seem to finish successfully
- Then I typed `make check`, which resulted in another very long text output, that did eventually seem to work as well
- Then I typed `make install`, and while this did show errors, I nonetheless was finally able to proceed to the smc++ installation
- Using pip, I was now able to install smc++
    - `pip install git+https://github.com/popgenmethods/smcpp`
- I was now able to check the version of smc++ (smc++ version), as well as use commands like the cite command (smc++), which seem to indicate that it is successfully installed
